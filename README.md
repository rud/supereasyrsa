# supereasyrsa
At some point I got confused and lost a couple of days in confusion using the "new" easyrsa-3 script,
then I threw together this small script to streamline the configuration of simple pki for openvpn.

Dependencies: tput openvpn openssl git

Usage:

0. Prepare a list of users and key passwords for your clients, as well as a PEM password
1. Put this script in an empty directory directory, dedicated to a VPN
2. Set the variables: Edit the variable section of the script to suit your needs
  ```
  #Variables:

  ##Server name (name that will define your server)
  servername="MyServer"

  ##Clients with password (list of clients, separated by a space)
  clientsnamesec="Client_01  Client_02  Client_03"

  ##Clients without password (list servers and mobiles - separated by a space)
  ### note that I include mobiles here because the android version bugs when a key is password protected
  ### Also, beware to ensure strong security on the mobile devised with VPN installed!!!
  clientsnamenonsec="otherserver mymobile"

  ## IP where the VPN is listening on
  serverlistip="1.2.3.4"

  ##public IP where the clients try to connect to
  serverip="1.2.3.4"

  ##server's listening port (port the server is listening on)
  serverlistport="1194"

  ##port where the clients connect to
  serverport="1194"

  ##LAN range to route
  lanrange="172.28.25.0"

  ##ip from local lan dns (as the clients could use specific local resolving inside vpn)
  dnsip="172.28.25.1"

  ##bits - don't change unless sure
  biits="4096"
````
3. Launch script - it should drive you through the generation of the keys and conf files.
4. sorted output will be located in "keys" directory (at same level as clients and server)
